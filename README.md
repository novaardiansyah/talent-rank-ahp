# Talent Rank - Decision Support System (DSS)

Hi Future Developer,

Welcome to **Talent Rank**! This project is a decision support system designed to select the best employees using the **Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP)** method. Built with the latest technologies, it provides a robust and efficient way to rank talent based on multiple criteria.

This system is divided into two primary roles:
- **Manager:** Responsible for managing criteria, weights, and final evaluations.
- **Employee:** Participants in the evaluation process.
